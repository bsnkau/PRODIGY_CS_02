This Python script utilizes the PIL (Python Imaging Library) and NumPy to encrypt and decrypt images using a XOR-based technique with a designated encryption key. The process involves converting an image into a numerical array, applying XOR operations between the array elements and the key for encryption and decryption, and then saving the processed image back to file. he script demonstrates how to protect and recover image data using simple cryptographic principles
